## week 2 assignment

##### Choose six recent popular movies. Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) to rate each of these movie that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. Take the results (observations) and store them in a SQL database. Load the information into an R dataframe. Your deliverables should include your SQL scripts and your R Markdown code, posted to GitHub.

##### Answer:
```{r}
con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres()
     , host='amrepdev.ckxhi71v1dqf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com'
     , port='5432'
     , dbname='postgres'
     , user='nichung'
     , password=Sys.getenv("pwd"))

dbExistsTable(con, "movie_ratings")

df <- dbGetQuery(con, '
  SELECT * FROM movie_ratings
')
df
```
