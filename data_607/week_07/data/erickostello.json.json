        "text": "I was *very* lucky to have hired Matt and work with him for two years at Magid. He was an excellent colleague who came in to our very complex data science environment, while we were transitioning into a higher volume mode. In an extremely reasonable amount of time he first became a productive contributor and then took on more and more responsibilities and leadership role. He took the initiative on key projects and managed them successfully to completion. He is not only highly reliable, he is very interested in getting things done right, combined with willingness to experiment and always considers the impact on all stakeholders. Matt is amiable and unassuming, highly intelligent and always seeking to make his work and the products/projects he works on the highest quality... unless the project is scoped as quick and dirty and then he adjusts accordingly. During the time I worked with Matt, I found that Matt was ready and willing for more responsibility and eager for new challenges. I highly recommend Matt for any role where someone with statistical skills, product development skills, SQL, R or R/Shiny programming, etc. and an inquisitive, insightful and industrious, team-oriented person would be a good fit. \n\n...

We have worked together on various projects and he has always been a thoughtful, insightful, and resourceful colleague. I have counted on Marc for everything from project management, to client consulting, to product development. He always shows a dedication to quality, and is driven by an innate desire to truly deliver what is needed. He has a natural curiosity and a passion for understanding that makes him a highly valuable participant in analytical projects, data-driven consulting, and… well, anything like that. Marc is also a friendly person, but more than being friendly, he always adds to team unity, cohesiveness, etc. Marc is an invaluable contributor to the team here at Magid!\n\n\n\n... See more"
