# 1. question 
![source: Numbersense, Kaiser Fung, McGraw HIll, 2013](week05.png)
##### The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations. Your task is to:
##### (1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
##### (2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.
##### (3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
##### (4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your homework submission:
* The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
* The URL for your rpubs.com web page.

# 2. methodology
##### 1. build original table in csv
##### 2. load and melt

# 2-1. data loading
```{r}
# read csv into R
raw_data <- read.csv("airline_delays.csv", sep = ",")#, check.names = FALSE)
raw_data
```

# 2-2. observations
###### this dataset contains four variables:
* airline, stored in the rows
* status, stored in the rows
* city, spread across the column names,
* count, stored in the cell values

```{r}
# modify column names for easier reference and drop row with blank values 
headers.raw_data <- raw_data %>% 
  rename(airline = 1, status = 2) %>%
  drop_na()
headers.raw_data
```

# 2-3. tidying
##### data cleaning requires that:
* the city names are gathered into a column against counts
* the status are spread against count
* city values have spaces instead of periods
* descriptive calculations are available for analysis and visualization

```{r}
# melt city and count
molten.raw_data <- headers.raw_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(airline, status), names_to = "city", values_to = "count")
head(molten.raw_data)
```

```{r}
# cast status and count
casted.raw_data <- molten.raw_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "status", values_from = "count")
head(casted.raw_data)
```

```{r}
# replace period with spaces for values in column "city"
casted.raw_data$city <- str_replace_all(casted.raw_data$city, "\\.", " ")
head(casted.raw_data)
```

```{r}
# new column for total flights
casted.raw_data$flights <- casted.raw_data$`on time` + casted.raw_data$delayed

# new column for percentage of flights that are delayed
casted.raw_data$delayed_rate <- casted.raw_data$delayed / casted.raw_data$flights
casted.raw_data
```

# 3. Findings
```{r}
boxplot(casted.raw_data$delayed_rate, casted.raw_data$airline, main = "tst")
```
