# 1. question 
![source: Numbersense, Kaiser Fung, McGraw HIll, 2013](week05.png)
##### The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations. Your task is to:
##### (1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
##### (2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.
##### (3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
##### (4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your homework submission:
##### * The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
##### * The URL for your rpubs.com web page.

# 2. methodology
##### 1. build original table in csv
##### 2. load and melt

# 2-1. data loading
```{r}
# read csv into R
raw_data <- read.csv("airline_delays.csv", sep = ",")
raw_data
```

```{r}

```
